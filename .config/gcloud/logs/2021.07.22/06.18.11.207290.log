    gcloud config - view and edit Cloud SDK properties

[m[1mSYNOPSIS[m
    [1mgcloud config[m [4mGROUP[m | [4mCOMMAND[m [[4mGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...[m]

[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    The gcloud config command group lets you set, view and unset properties
    used by Cloud SDK.

    A configuration is a set of properties that govern the behavior of [1mgcloud[m
    and other Cloud SDK tools. The initial [1mdefault[m configuration is set when
    [1mgcloud init[m is run. You can create additional named configurations using
    [1mgcloud init[m or [1mgcloud config configurations create[m.

    To display the path of the active configuration along with information
    about the current [1mgcloud[m environment, run $ gcloud info.

    To switch between configurations, use [1mgcloud config configurations
    activate[m.

    gcloud supports several flags that have the same effect as properties in a
    configuration (for example, gcloud supports both the [1m--project[m flag and
    [1mproject[m property). Properties differ from flags in that flags affect
    command behavior on a per-invocation basis. Properties allow you to
    maintain the same settings across command executions.

    In addition to setting properties in a configuration, and the use of flags,
    it is possible to override the value of a property with an environment
    variable. The matching environment variable for a property is of the form
    'CLOUDSDK_CATEGORY_PROPERTY'. For example, to demonstrate overriding the
    [1m[1;4mproject[1m[m property in the [1m[1;4mcore[1m[m category to [1m[1;4mmy-project[1m[m, use a command like:

        $ CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=my-project gcloud config get-value \
            core/project

    For more information on configurations, see [1mgcloud topic configurations[m.

[m[1mGCLOUD WIDE FLAGS[m
    These flags are available to all commands: --help.

    Run [1m$ gcloud help[m for details.

[m[1mGROUPS[m
    [1m[1;4mGROUP[1m[m is one of the following:

     [1mconfigurations[m
        Manage the set of gcloud named configurations.

[m[1mCOMMANDS[m
    [1m[1;4mCOMMAND[1m[m is one of the following:

     [1mget-value[m
        Print the value of a Cloud SDK property.

     [1mlist[m
        List Cloud SDK properties for the currently active configuration.

     [1mset[m
        Set a Cloud SDK property.

     [1munset[m
        Unset a Cloud SDK property.

[m[1mAVAILABLE PROPERTIES[m
     [4mcore[m
         [1maccount[m
            Account [1mgcloud[m should use for authentication. Run [1mgcloud auth list[m
            to see your currently available accounts.

         [1mcustom_ca_certs_file[m
            Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.

         [1mdefault_regional_backend_service[m
            If True, backend services in [1mgcloud compute backend-services[m will
            be regional by default. Setting the [1m--global[m flag is required for
            global backend services.

         [1mdisable_color[m
            If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the
            terminal.

         [1mdisable_file_logging[m
            If True, [1mgcloud[m will not store logs to a file. This may be useful
            if disk space is limited.

         [1mdisable_prompts[m
            If True, the default answer will be assumed for all user prompts.
            However, for any prompts that require user input, an error will be
            raised. This is equivalent to either using the global [1m--quiet[m flag
            or setting the environment variable [1mCLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS[m
            to 1. Setting this property is useful when scripting with [1mgcloud[m.

         [1mdisable_usage_reporting[m
            If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected.
            This value is set by default based on your choices during
            installation, but can be changed at any time. For more information,
            see: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage-statistics

         [1mlog_http[m
            If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. To see logs
            in the terminal, adjust [1mverbosity[m settings. Otherwise, logs are
            available in their respective log files.

         [1mmax_log_days[m
            Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set
            to 0, turns off log garbage collection and does not delete log
            files. If unset, the default is 30 days.

         [1mpass_credentials_to_gsutil[m
            If True, pass the configured Cloud SDK authentication to gsutil.

         [1mproject[m
            Project ID of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by default.
            This can be overridden by using the global [1m--project[m flag.

         [1mshow_structured_logs[m
                Control when JSON-structured log messages for the current verbosity
                level (and above) will be written to standard error. If this property
                is disabled, logs are formatted as `text` by default.

                Valid values are:
                    *   `never` - Log messages as text
                    *   `always` - Always log messages as JSON
                    *   `log` - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a file
                    *    `terminal` - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a terminal

                If unset, default is `never`.

         [1mtrace_token[m
            Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
            issues. This token will be provided by Google support.

         [1muser_output_enabled[m
            True, by default. If False, messages to the user and command output
            on both standard output and standard error will be suppressed.

         [1mverbosity[m
            Default logging verbosity for [1mgcloud[m commands. This is the
            equivalent of using the global [1m--verbosity[m flag. Supported
            verbosity levels: [1mdebug[m, [1minfo[m, [1mwarning[m, [1merror[m, [1mcritical[m, and [1mnone[m.

     [4maccessibility[m
         [1mscreen_reader[m
            Make gcloud more screen reader friendly.

     [4mai[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with AI Platform resources. When
            a [1m--region[m flag is required but not provided, the command will fall
            back to this value, if set.

     [4mai_platform[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with AI Platform Training and
            Prediction resources (currently for Prediction only). It is ignored
            for training resources for now. The value should be either [1mglobal[m
            or one of the supported regions. When a [1m--region[m flag is required
            but not provided, the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     [4mapp[m
         [1mcloud_build_timeout[m
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for Docker builds to complete during
            deployments. All Docker builds now use the Cloud Build API.

         [1mpromote_by_default[m
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version
            will be promoted to receive all traffic for the service. This
            property can be overridden via the [1m--promote-by-default[m or
            [1m--no-promote-by-default[m flags.

         [1mstop_previous_version[m
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, the previously
            deployed version is stopped. If False, older versions must be
            stopped manually.

         [1muse_runtime_builders[m
            If set, opt in/out to a new code path for building applications
            using pre-fabricated runtimes that can be updated independently of
            client tooling. If not set, the default path for each runtime is
            used.

     [4martifacts[m
         [1mlocation[m
            Default location to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a [1mlocation[m value is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. If this value is
            unset, the default location is [1mglobal[m when [1mlocation[m value is
            optional.

         [1mrepository[m
            Default repository to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a [1mrepository[m value is required but not provided,
            the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     [4mauth[m
         [1mdisable_credentials[m
            If True, [1mgcloud[m will not attempt to load any credentials or
            authenticate any requests. This is useful when behind a proxy that
            adds authentication to requests.

         [1mimpersonate_service_account[m
            After setting this property, all API requests will be made as the
            given service account instead of the currently selected account.
            This is done without needing to create, download, and activate a
            key for the account. In order to perform operations as the service
            account, your currently selected account must have an IAM role that
            includes the iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission for the
            service account. The roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role has
            this permission or you may create a custom role. A list of service
            accounts, separated with comma, can be specified. In such cases, it
            creates an impersonation delegation chain. Any given service
            account in the list must have the
            roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on its subsequent service
            account. For example, when
            --impersonate-service-account=sv1@developer.gserviceaccount.com,sv2@developer.gserviceaccount.com,
            the active account must have the
            roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on
            sv1@developer.gserviceaccount.com which must has the
            roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on
            sv2@developer.gserviceaccount.com.
            sv2@developer.gserviceaccount.com is target impersonated service
            account and sv1@developer.gserviceaccount.com is the delegate.

     [4mbilling[m
         [1mquota_project[m
                Project that will be charged quota for the
                operations performed in `gcloud`. When unset, the default is
                [CURRENT_PROJECT]; this will charge quota against the currently set
                project for operations performed on it. Additionally, some existing
                APIs will continue to use a shared project for quota by default, when
                this property is unset.

                If you need to operate on one project, but
                need quota against a different project, you can use this property to
                specify the alternate project.

     [4mbuilds[m
         [1mkaniko_cache_ttl[m
            TTL, in hours, of cached layers when using Kaniko. If zero, layer
            caching is disabled.

         [1mtimeout[m
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for builds to complete. If unset,
            defaults to 10 minutes.

         [1muse_kaniko[m
            If True, kaniko will be used to build images described by a
            Dockerfile, instead of [1mdocker build[m.

     [4mcomponent_manager[m
         [1madditional_repositories[m
            Comma separated list of additional repositories to check for
            components. This property is automatically managed by the [1mgcloud
            components repositories[m commands.

         [1mdisable_update_check[m
            If True, Cloud SDK will not automatically check for updates.

     [4mcomposer[m
         [1mlocation[m
            Composer location to use. Each Composer location constitutes an
            independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
            environments into Compute Engine regions inside this location. This
            parameter corresponds to the /locations/<location> segment of the
            Composer resource URIs being referenced.

     [4mcompute[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with regional Compute Engine
            resources. When a [1m--region[m flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices,
            run [1mgcloud compute regions list[m.

         [1muse_new_list_usable_subnets_api[m
            If True, use the new API for listing usable subnets which only
            returns subnets in the current project.

         [1mzone[m
            Default zone to use when working with zonal Compute Engine
            resources. When a [1m--zone[m flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices,
            run [1mgcloud compute zones list[m.

     [4mcontainer[m
         [1mbuild_timeout[m
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for container builds to complete.

         [1mcluster[m
            Name of the cluster to use by default when working with Kubernetes
            Engine.

         [1muse_application_default_credentials[m
            If True, use application default credentials to authenticate to the
            cluster API server.

         [1muse_client_certificate[m
            If True, use the cluster's client certificate to authenticate to
            the cluster API server.

     [4mcontext_aware[m
         [1muse_client_certificate[m
            If True, use client certificate to authorize user device using
            Context-aware access. Some services may not support client
            certificate authorization. If a command sends requests to such
            services, the client certificate will not be validated. Run [1mgcloud
            topic client-certificate[m for list of services supporting this
            feature.

     [4mdataflow[m
         [1mdisable_public_ips[m
            Specifies that Cloud Dataflow workers must not use public IP
            addresses.

         [1menable_streaming_engine[m
