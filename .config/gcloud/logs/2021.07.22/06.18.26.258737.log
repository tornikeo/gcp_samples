[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    gcloud config list lists all properties of the active configuration. These
    include the account used to authorize access to the Cloud Platform, the
    current Cloud Platform project, and the default Compute Engine region and
    zone, if set. See [1mgcloud topic configurations[m for more about
    configurations.

[m[1mEXAMPLES[m
    To list the project property in the core section, run:

        $ gcloud config list project

    To list the zone property in the compute section, run:

        $ gcloud config list compute/zone

    To list all the properties, run:

        $ gcloud config list --all

    Note, you cannot specify both --all and a property name.

[m[1mPOSITIONAL ARGUMENTS[m
     [[4mSECTION[m/[4mPROPERTY[m]
        Property to be listed. Note that SECTION/ is optional while referring
        to properties in the core section.

[m[1mFLAGS[m
     [1m--all[m
        List all set and unset properties that match the arguments.

[m[1mLIST COMMAND FLAGS[m
     [1m--filter[m=[4mEXPRESSION[m
        Apply a Boolean filter [4mEXPRESSION[m to each resource item to be listed.
        If the expression evaluates [1mTrue[m, then that item is listed. For more
        details and examples of filter expressions, run $ gcloud topic filters.
        This flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        [1m--flatten[m, [1m--sort-by[m, [1m--filter[m, [1m--limit[m.

     [1m--limit[m=[4mLIMIT[m
        Maximum number of resources to list. The default is [1munlimited[m. This
        flag interacts with other flags that are applied in this order:
        [1m--flatten[m, [1m--sort-by[m, [1m--filter[m, [1m--limit[m.

     [1m--sort-by[m=[[4mFIELD[m,...]
        Comma-separated list of resource field key names to sort by. The
        default order is ascending. Prefix a field with ``~'' for descending
        order on that field. This flag interacts with other flags that are
        applied in this order: [1m--flatten[m, [1m--sort-by[m, [1m--filter[m, [1m--limit[m.

[m[1mGCLOUD WIDE FLAGS[m
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run [1m$ gcloud help[m for details.

[m[1mAVAILABLE PROPERTIES[m
     [4mcore[m
         [1maccount[m
            Account [1mgcloud[m should use for authentication. Run [1mgcloud auth list[m
            to see your currently available accounts.

         [1mcustom_ca_certs_file[m
            Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.

         [1mdefault_regional_backend_service[m
            If True, backend services in [1mgcloud compute backend-services[m will
            be regional by default. Setting the [1m--global[m flag is required for
            global backend services.

         [1mdisable_color[m
            If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the
            terminal.

         [1mdisable_file_logging[m
            If True, [1mgcloud[m will not store logs to a file. This may be useful
            if disk space is limited.

         [1mdisable_prompts[m
            If True, the default answer will be assumed for all user prompts.
            However, for any prompts that require user input, an error will be
            raised. This is equivalent to either using the global [1m--quiet[m flag
            or setting the environment variable [1mCLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS[m
            to 1. Setting this property is useful when scripting with [1mgcloud[m.

         [1mdisable_usage_reporting[m
            If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected.
            This value is set by default based on your choices during
            installation, but can be changed at any time. For more information,
            see: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage-statistics

         [1mlog_http[m
            If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. To see logs
            in the terminal, adjust [1mverbosity[m settings. Otherwise, logs are
            available in their respective log files.

         [1mmax_log_days[m
            Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set
            to 0, turns off log garbage collection and does not delete log
            files. If unset, the default is 30 days.

         [1mpass_credentials_to_gsutil[m
            If True, pass the configured Cloud SDK authentication to gsutil.

         [1mproject[m
            Project ID of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by default.
            This can be overridden by using the global [1m--project[m flag.

         [1mshow_structured_logs[m
                Control when JSON-structured log messages for the current verbosity
                level (and above) will be written to standard error. If this property
                is disabled, logs are formatted as `text` by default.

                Valid values are:
                    *   `never` - Log messages as text
                    *   `always` - Always log messages as JSON
                    *   `log` - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a file
                    *    `terminal` - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a terminal

                If unset, default is `never`.

         [1mtrace_token[m
            Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
            issues. This token will be provided by Google support.

         [1muser_output_enabled[m
            True, by default. If False, messages to the user and command output
            on both standard output and standard error will be suppressed.

         [1mverbosity[m
            Default logging verbosity for [1mgcloud[m commands. This is the
            equivalent of using the global [1m--verbosity[m flag. Supported
            verbosity levels: [1mdebug[m, [1minfo[m, [1mwarning[m, [1merror[m, [1mcritical[m, and [1mnone[m.

     [4maccessibility[m
         [1mscreen_reader[m
            Make gcloud more screen reader friendly.

     [4mai[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with AI Platform resources. When
            a [1m--region[m flag is required but not provided, the command will fall
            back to this value, if set.

     [4mai_platform[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with AI Platform Training and
            Prediction resources (currently for Prediction only). It is ignored
            for training resources for now. The value should be either [1mglobal[m
            or one of the supported regions. When a [1m--region[m flag is required
            but not provided, the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     [4mapp[m
         [1mcloud_build_timeout[m
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for Docker builds to complete during
            deployments. All Docker builds now use the Cloud Build API.

         [1mpromote_by_default[m
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version
            will be promoted to receive all traffic for the service. This
            property can be overridden via the [1m--promote-by-default[m or
            [1m--no-promote-by-default[m flags.

         [1mstop_previous_version[m
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, the previously
            deployed version is stopped. If False, older versions must be
            stopped manually.

         [1muse_runtime_builders[m
            If set, opt in/out to a new code path for building applications
            using pre-fabricated runtimes that can be updated independently of
            client tooling. If not set, the default path for each runtime is
            used.

     [4martifacts[m
         [1mlocation[m
            Default location to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a [1mlocation[m value is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. If this value is
            unset, the default location is [1mglobal[m when [1mlocation[m value is
            optional.

         [1mrepository[m
            Default repository to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a [1mrepository[m value is required but not provided,
            the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     [4mauth[m
         [1mdisable_credentials[m
            If True, [1mgcloud[m will not attempt to load any credentials or
            authenticate any requests. This is useful when behind a proxy that
            adds authentication to requests.

         [1mimpersonate_service_account[m
            After setting this property, all API requests will be made as the
            given service account instead of the currently selected account.
            This is done without needing to create, download, and activate a
            key for the account. In order to perform operations as the service
            account, your currently selected account must have an IAM role that
            includes the iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission for the
            service account. The roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role has
            this permission or you may create a custom role. A list of service
            accounts, separated with comma, can be specified. In such cases, it
            creates an impersonation delegation chain. Any given service
            account in the list must have the
            roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on its subsequent service
            account. For example, when
            --impersonate-service-account=sv1@developer.gserviceaccount.com,sv2@developer.gserviceaccount.com,
            the active account must have the
            roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on
            sv1@developer.gserviceaccount.com which must has the
            roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on
            sv2@developer.gserviceaccount.com.
            sv2@developer.gserviceaccount.com is target impersonated service
            account and sv1@developer.gserviceaccount.com is the delegate.

     [4mbilling[m
         [1mquota_project[m
                Project that will be charged quota for the
                operations performed in `gcloud`. When unset, the default is
                [CURRENT_PROJECT]; this will charge quota against the currently set
                project for operations performed on it. Additionally, some existing
                APIs will continue to use a shared project for quota by default, when
                this property is unset.

                If you need to operate on one project, but
                need quota against a different project, you can use this property to
                specify the alternate project.
